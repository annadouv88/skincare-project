✔ Normal
✔ Oily
✔ Combination
✔ Sensitive

What it is:
A daily gel cleanser with natural fruit exfoliant that thoroughly but gently lifts impurities and unclogs pores while leaving skin soft and hydrated.

Solutions for:
- Pores
- Dullness and uneven texture
- Oiliness

If you want to know more…
The Deep Cleanse oil-free gel lathers into a creamy foam to lift away dirt, oil, and impurities without over-drying. It cleanses with amino acids derived from silk gentle enough for even the most delicate skin, leaving skin soft, refreshed, and comfortably hydrated.

The formula harnesses the power of the Japanese luffa fruit, a natural beauty multitasker beloved by Japanese women for centuries. Ground fibers from the fruit exfoliate, helping to turn over dead skin cells while purifying and decongesting pores. The fruit extract also beautifies and conditions skin. Japanese wild rose works to visibly tighten pores and smooth skin texture, while Japanese leopard lily helps minimize excess oil.

What else you need to know:
Harvested under a full autumn moon, the water of luffa fruit has been prized as a favorite natural skincare ingredient in Japan since the Edo period. It is beloved for its clarifying and moisturizing properties. When dried and ground, the fruit gently exfoliates to purify and smooth skin texture—the original inspiration for the modern day loofah sponge. The Deep Cleanse harnesses this time-tested ingredient in this refreshing, easy-to-use daily exfoliating cleanser.

This pure, oil-free formula is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, and cruelty-free. It is formulated without synthetic fragrances, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, of TEA.

This product is an Allure Best of Beauty award winner.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. The brand focuses on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. All of their products are designed to be mixed together—what Drunk Elephant calls making a smoothie. (This is true for all of their products except their sunscreen, Umbra, which sits on top of the skin, protecting it from UV damage.) The result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

The brand focuses on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. All of their products are designed to be mixed together—what Drunk Elephant calls making a smoothie. (This is true for all of their products except their sunscreen, Umbra, which sits on top of the skin, protecting it from UV damage.) The result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.

Using his unrivaled clinical experience, Dr. Lancer worked to develop a line of technologically advanced, active ingredient-focused products designed to improve the overall health and appearance of skin, while also giving patients the sought-after ‘Lancer Glow.’ Backed by first-class dermatology, utmost luxury, and true efficacy, Lancer skincare seeks to bring “believable beauty” to all skin.

The Lancer Method, the core of Dr. Lancer’s philosophy, is based on a biological principle universal to all skin: the cellular cycle of renewal. By devising a system that supports this process through manual exfoliation, Dr. Lancer was able to create a unique anti-aging line that delivers beautiful, glowing results to all skin types. The three steps of The Lancer Method dramatically improve the appearance of fine lines, texture, discoloration, and pore size. All of the Lancer treatments are formulated for optimum efficacy and luminous results.

Dr. Lancer insider tip: ""The skin is an organ of absorption. Your face is exposed to many harmful environmental stressors. Keeping it meticulously clean is a very effective anti-aging strategy.""

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. The brand focuses on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. All of their products are designed to be mixed together—what Drunk Elephant calls making a smoothie. (This is true for all of their products except their sunscreen, Umbra, which sits on top of the skin, protecting it from UV damage.) The result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

This gentle cleanser is packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays, while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside. It is gluten-free, hypoallergenic, and suitable for women who are pregnant and breastfeeding.

Skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an ""edible"" ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Their products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics.

The brand doesn’t compromise on results. While they are incredibly passionate about the purity of their ingredients list, they are equally ardent about ensuring that products are efficacious and a sensorial delight to use.

The use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, they provide potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

Edible Beauty’s entire range is 100 percent vegan, earth-friendly, and cruelty-free.

Edible Beauty Australia’s founder, naturopath Anna Mitsios, is incredibly passionate about using herbs and nutrition to illuminate natural beauty on the inside and out. While working at a fertility clinic, she discovered that there were no ""edible"" skincare products she could recommend to her patients. This sparked the idea to create a natural, therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare line, and Edible Beauty Australia was born.

Photo damage and aging are visibly diminished, replaced by incredible radiance and luminosity. With a 3.3 pH, C-Firma will likely change color over the course of its life on your shelf, but don‘t be alarmed—anything from a pale yellow to an amber orange is completely normal and not a sign the ascorbic acid is ineffective. Drunk Elephant recommends using C-Firma within six months after opening, and if you‘re using it as directed—one pump per day—one bottle will last about three to four months.
This serum is free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance.
Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. The brand focuses on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. All of their products are designed to be mixed together—what Drunk Elephant calls making a smoothie. (This is true for all of their products except their sunscreen, Umbra, which sits on top of the skin, protecting it from UV damage.) The result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.
Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Ingredient Callouts: These products are vegan and cruelty-free.

What Else You Need to Know: The B-Hydra™ Intensive Hydration Serum delivers steady hydration all day as it visibly diminishes drabness, dryness, and fine lines for skin that appears healthy, brighter, and more youthful. The C-Firma™ Day Serum enzymatically dissolves dead skin cells as it intensely hydrates. Photodamage and signs of aging are visibly diminished and replaced by the look of incredible radiance and luminosity.

These products are free of essential oils, silicones, fragrance, PEGs, and irritants.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. The brand focuses on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. All of their products are designed to be mixed together—what Drunk Elephant calls making a smoothie. (This is true for all of their products except their sunscreen, Umbra, which sits on top of the skin, protecting it from UV damage.) The result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

If you want to know more…
Capture Youth offers five targeted serums to meet the specific needs of each skin type. Enriched with antioxidant-rich iris extract, each serum is infused with a naturally-derived active ingredient to target and treat a specific skin concern: dullness, dryness, lack of firmness, oily skin, and redness. These serums are formulated to be used with the universal antioxidant cream for maximum efficacy.

- Glow Booster Serum (to target dullness): vitamin C and AHA combine to brighten and even skin.
- Plump Filler Serum (for dryness/lack of density): hyaluronic acid from fermented wheat hydrates and replenishes the skin to make it appear fuller and more supple.
- Lift Sculptor Serum (for lack of firmness/wrinkles): polyphenols derived from a tea blend boost elastin production to visibly lift and sculpt the skin for firmer, more defined skin contours.
- Matte Maximizer Serum (for oily skin): lactic acid derived from sugar cane regulates excess sebum to help reduce shine and refine pores.
- Redness Soother Serum (for red, irritated skin): natural peptides from cotton reduce redness and irritation for a smoother, more even complexion.
- Intense Rescue Age-Delay Revitalizing Oil-Serum (for dry, dehydrated skin): intensive, lipid-replenishing oil-serum that strengthens the skin's natural barrier to help repair dryness on the skin's surface and maintain hydration.

If you want to know more…
This multifunctional anti-aging serum offers a daily-dose of anti-aging defense. The silky liquid texture is readily absorbed allowing for immediate delivery of the efficacious ingredients. Serums are intended to be used with a moisturizer or blended with another product. It is the ideal companion to any of our moisturizers (Double-Duty Face Moisturizer SPF 20, Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer, Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream, or Line Smoother 8% Glycolic Acid Treatment) or Post Shave Cooling Gel. Except for customers with oily skin, serums are not intended to provide adequate hydration when used alone.

Peptides are chains of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) that are essential to human life. They function as messengers in the skin, allowing the epidermis and dermis to communicate more efficiently. As we age, communication diminishes within the skin resulting in fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity. Peptides improve cell communication by sending specific signals that affect skin's response.

The source of the Red Hibiscus is the Dior Garden located in the heart of the Koro Ecological and Cultural Site. In this garden, covering 20 hectares, nearly 190 plant species flourish, representing an astonishing 18 percent of all species found in Burkina Faso. This remarkable site was selected due to its distinctive geology and the richness of its soil. More than a hectare is entirely devoted to cultivating the hibiscus sabdariffa, or red hibiscus.

The Dior Research Center studied the red hibiscus flower and discovered extraordinary detoxifying power. Red hibiscus extract has been shown to stimulate the recycling process of toxins that have penetrated the cell's lung.

What it is:
A resculpting treatment serum to reshape, define, and lift the look of skin for a youthful appearance.

Solutions for:
- Fine lines and wrinkles

If you want to know more…
This oil-free, innovative resculpting serum is formulated with Caudalie's new breakthrough patent of stabilized vine resveratrol (for firmness) and micro hyaluronic acids (for volume) to visibly recontour, refirm, and replump aging skin. For the first time, these molecules' synergy is being harnessed to support skin's natural production of hyaluronic acid, so the skin is plumped from within. The formula is further enriched with a peptide composition that works on natural collagen and elastin to lift the look of facial contours and reduce visible effects of aging. The light, hydrating texture blends into the skin without any sticky residue and can be applied under makeup.

What else you need to know:
This product is vegan.

Resveratrol Lift Firming Serum is winner of a Women’s Health 2017 Beauty Award.

Research has unveiled a surprising synergy between a molecule from grapevine called resveratrol, and a complex of micro hyaluronic acids. While each ingredient is effective on its own, the combination is a breakthrough because it helps support the skin's own production of natural hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is naturally present in the skin and plays an important role in hydration and preservation. A decrease in hyaluronic acid quantity and quality with age leads to dryness and the appearance of wrinkles. Caudalie's new patented complex helps support the skin to make its own natural hylauronic acid. This product is noncomedogenic and tested under dermatological supervision.

If you want to know more…
This power-packed serum is a natural and effective time machine for the skin. It reenergizes sluggish skin cells so they act younger and perform their critical functions, like natural collagen synthesis more effectively. With every application, skin cells work faster and harder to firm, tone, brighten, and smooth. Or in other words, return skin to its most youthful state. This serum is formulated with Caudalie’s three signature patents: resveratrol to visibly lift and firm, Viniferine® to brighten, and grape seed polyphenols to protect against environmental aggressors. Together, these powerhouse ingredients further enhance the serum’s anti-aging benefits and boost the effectiveness of any subsequent cream. The formula is further enriched with niacinimide (vitamin B3) to protect skin from UV damage, age spots, and hyperpigmentation, as well as boost hydration and act as an anti-inflammatory. The silky, weightless texture glides over skin and absorbs quickly and features a subtle, natural rose scent.

What else you need to know:
Powering this support in skin cell energy is Vinergy®, a breakthrough anti-aging complex co-patented with Harvard Medical School. It took five years to perfect the Vinergy formula, which is exclusive to this innovative serum.

""For the past five years, I have collaborated with Caudalie to research and develop ground-breaking, anti-aging innovations. Together we've discovered a solution to counteract the diminishing energy metabolism of our cells over time, which is a key reason our skin ages. Our groundbreaking discovery of vinergy helps to restore the cells' mitochondrial mass and energy production, which in turn allows our cells to defend against aging.""—Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School

If you want to know more…
This youth-boosting elixir contains an abundance of Australian wildcrafted ingredients that naturally turn back the clock. Kakadu plum, edelweiss, lilli pilli (also known as ripeberry), and acerola cherry are supercharged with antioxidants to enhance visible firmness, support collagen production, and even tone, while shielding against free radical and UV damage. Hyaluronic acid—which holds 1,000 times its weight in water—plumps and hydrates skin.

What else you need to know:
This product is vegan, formulated without gluten, hypoallergenic, and cruelty-free. It is suitable for women who are pregnant and breastfeeding.

Edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside.

Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

A hydrating overnight treatment oil to nourish and condition skin, with a powerful key ingredient extracted from the nut kernels of the tamanu fruit.

What it does:
When used as an overnight hydration treatment, Volcanic Elixir works while you sleep. It delivers rich hydration, conditions damaged skin, soothes acne-prone skin, and helps improve the look of the overall skin complexion.

This elixir is rich in antioxidant and skin-calming properties, making it ideal for conditioning dry skin and eczema. The naturally earthy aroma of the tamanu oil explodes in the Volcanic Elixir as it's unmasked by filler ingredients or artificial fragrances. It's 100-percent real, raw, and natural.

This Polynesian beauty oil is extracted from the nut kernels of the tamanu fruit—which flourishes in the islands of the South Pacific, thanks to the volcanic atmosphere there. Not only does volcanic ash provide nutrients to surrounding soil, but it also contains minerals that are beneficial to plants. Due to this very reason, the tamanu oil originating from Polynesia contains the highest nutritional value.

Volcanic Elixir can also be used on the face or body as a daily moisturizer.

So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t.

The brand focuses on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. All of their products are designed to be mixed together—what Drunk Elephant calls making a smoothie.

The result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*

The quality, texture, absorption, and aroma is unlike any other oil on the market. Discover what thousands of Kopari fans have—not all coconut is created equal.

What else you need to know:
This product features limited-edition Hydration packaging to celebrate Murad’s 30-year anniversary as the skincare hydration experts.

Just a dime-sized amount of Nutrient-Charged Water Gel provides enough hydration for wearing alone, or underneath your SPF and makeup. It is cruelty-free, and formulated without gluten and animal-derived ingredients.

There are many factors that contribute to a damaged skin barrier, including emotional stress, fatigue, dehydration, pollution, and over-exfoliation. When the barrier is damaged, skin experiences redness, dryness, and tightness. However, when the barrier is healthy, skin appears even-toned, clear, smooth, and balanced.

""‘Eat your water’ is a phrase I have been using for many years. Staying sufficiently hydrated isn’t just about drinking eight glasses of water a day. When we eat more water-rich foods, we absorb water more slowly because it is trapped in the nutritional structure of these foods. Slow absorption means that water in food stays in our bodies longer to optimize hydration. The same rule applies to skin. Applying nutrient-rich ingredients will strengthen the skin barrier and help our skin trap and hold onto more water, longer. That’s how the formula for Nutrient-Charged Water Gel was born.""—Howard Murad, M.D., FAAD

No other molecule has fueled as much hope for health, notably in the field of cell degeneration.

Grapevines have an incredible power to resist the harsh effects of the cold, wind and rain to live for up to 100 years. Their secret? Resveratrol, a substance that the vine produces to protect itself.

Research results:
In an in vitro test on genic expression; vine resveratrol with micro hyaluronic acids:
- Boosts the skin’s own production of hyaluronic acid by 226%

In a self-assessment with 42 volunteers, after 3 months of once-daily application:
- 100% of the volunteers feel that their skin is nourished
- 100% of the volunteers feel that their skin is firmed
- 93% of the volunteers feel that their skin complexion is brighter
- 93% of the volunteers feel that their skin is lifted
- 88% of the volunteers feel that their skin is plumper
- 88% of the volunteers feel that their skin looks younger
- 81% of the volunteers feel that the wrinkles are smoothed
- 76% of the volunteers feel that their facial contours are redefined

Maximum improvement reached after 3 months on the biomechanical properties of skin:
- 100% of volunteers saw +15% improvement in skin firmness
- 93% of volunteers saw -39% reduction of skin sagging
- 88% of volunteers saw +13% plumper skin

Edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside.

Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t. What they wanted were no-nonsense products that worked as advertised and used the best ingredients—and were never, ever tested on animals. Nothing complicated. Nothing cosmetic. Just superior skincare. Welcome to the number one bestselling men’s skincare brand.*
