- dullness and brightening

if you want to know more…
the juju bar is a multitasking exfoliating bar designed to effectively cleanse while gently removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. uniquely formulated with thermal mud and bamboo powder, juju bar creates a creamy lather that dissolves unwanted oil, rinsing away pore-clogging surface debris and any impurities. it refines skin texture, brightens skin clarity, and helps minimize the look of pores.

truly in a league of its own, pekee bar™ is a gentle cleansing bar that moisturizes, clarifies, and balances the complexion. infused with a blend of blueberry extract, marula oil, and honey, pekee bar tones and promotes moisture retention.

this set contains:
- 1 oz/ 30 g pekee bar™
- 1 oz/ 30 g juju bar

what else you need to know:
unlike soap, which has a ph level of nine or above, the juju bar and pekee bar are formulated with skin-friendly ingredients designed to cleanse and soothe the skin. the juju bar has an ideal ph-level of 6.3 and pekee bar is at 6.3 to ensure sufficient cleansing without drying or stripping the skin of its protective barrier. both are free of soap, fragrance, essential oil, silicone, and irritant. juju bar is vegan.

drunk elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. the brand focuses on healthy ph levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. all of their products are designed to be mixed together—what drunk elephant calls making a smoothie. (this is true for all of their products except their sunscreen, umbra, which sits on top of the skin, protecting it from uv damage.) the result is skin that is reset to its happiest, healthiest state.

drunk elephant is a supporter of ief (international elephant foundation) and is cruelty-free.

skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. so, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. edible beauty australia’s gold standard for purity is an ""edible"" ingredient list. this means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. their products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics.

the brand doesn’t compromise on results. while they are incredibly passionate about the purity of their ingredients list, they are equally ardent about ensuring that products are efficacious and a sensorial delight to use.

the use of australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. found growing in remote and arid regions of australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. when used topically, they provide potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

edible beauty’s entire range is 100 percent vegan, earth-friendly, and cruelty-free.

edible beauty australia’s founder, naturopath anna mitsios, is incredibly passionate about using herbs and nutrition to illuminate natural beauty on the inside and out. while working at a fertility clinic, she discovered that there were no ""edible"" skincare products she could recommend to her patients. this sparked the idea to create a natural, therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare line, and edible beauty australia was born.

skincare concerns: fine lines and wrinkles, dullness and uneven texture, and loss of firmness and elasticity
formulation: lightweight serum
highlighted ingredients:
- potent antioxidant complex (15% l-ascorbic acid and ferulic acid and 1% vitamin e): firms and brightens the look and feel of skin while minimizing the visible signs of photoaging from pollution and other environmental stressors.
- pumpkin ferment and pomegranate extract: these ingredients work together to enzymatically dissolve dead surface skin cells, minimizing the appearance of pores.
- chronocyclin: a chronopeptide that mimics the antioxidant benefits of vitamin d for more youthful-looking skin.
what else you need to know: packed with a powerful antioxidant complex of l-ascorbic and ferulic acids to reveal a more even-looking complexion, c-firma™ helps enzymatically dissolve dead skin cells as it intensely hydrates. photo damage and aging are visibly diminished, replaced by incredible radiance and luminosity. with a 3.3 ph, c-firma will likely change color over the course of its life on your shelf, but don‘t be alarmed—anything from a pale yellow to an amber orange is completely normal and not a sign the ascorbic acid is ineffective. drunk elephant recommends using c-firma within six months after opening, and if you‘re using it as directed—one pump per day—one bottle will last about three to four months.
this serum is free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance.
drunk elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. the brand focuses on healthy ph levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support the skin’s acid mantle. all of their products are designed to be mixed together—what drunk elephant calls making a smoothie.

if you want to know more…
this oil-free, innovative resculpting serum is formulated with caudalie's new breakthrough patent of stabilized vine resveratrol (for firmness) and micro hyaluronic acids (for volume) to visibly recontour, refirm, and replump aging skin. for the first time, these molecules' synergy is being harnessed to support skin's natural production of hyaluronic acid, so the skin is plumped from within. the formula is further enriched with a peptide composition that works on natural collagen and elastin to lift the look of facial contours and reduce visible effects of aging. the light, hydrating texture blends into the skin without any sticky residue and can be applied under makeup.

what else you need to know:
this product is vegan.

resveratrol lift firming serum is winner of a women’s health 2017 beauty award.

research has unveiled a surprising synergy between a molecule from grapevine called resveratrol, and a complex of micro hyaluronic acids. while each ingredient is effective on its own, the combination is a breakthrough because it helps support the skin's own production of natural hyaluronic acid. hyaluronic acid is naturally present in the skin and plays an important role in hydration and preservation. a decrease in hyaluronic acid quantity and quality with age leads to dryness and the appearance of wrinkles. caudalie's new patented complex helps support the skin to make its own natural hylauronic acid. this product is noncomedogenic and tested under dermatological supervision.

this power-packed serum is a natural and effective time machine for the skin. it reenergizes sluggish skin cells so they act younger and perform their critical functions, like natural collagen synthesis more effectively. with every application, skin cells work faster and harder to firm, tone, brighten, and smooth. or in other words, return skin to its most youthful state. this serum is formulated with caudalie’s three signature patents: resveratrol to visibly lift and firm, viniferine® to brighten, and grape seed polyphenols to protect against environmental aggressors. together, these powerhouse ingredients further enhance the serum’s anti-aging benefits and boost the effectiveness of any subsequent cream. the formula is further enriched with niacinimide (vitamin b3) to protect skin from uv damage, age spots, and hyperpigmentation, as well as boost hydration and act as an anti-inflammatory. the silky, weightless texture glides over skin and absorbs quickly and features a subtle, natural rose scent.

wildcrafted: the use of australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. found growing in remote and arid regions of australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. when used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

this product features limited-edition hydration packaging to celebrate murad’s 30-year anniversary as the skincare hydration experts.

just a dime-sized amount of nutrient-charged water gel provides enough hydration for wearing alone, or underneath your spf and makeup. it is cruelty-free, and formulated without gluten and animal-derived ingredients.

there are many factors that contribute to a damaged skin barrier, including emotional stress, fatigue, dehydration, pollution, and over-exfoliation. when the barrier is damaged, skin experiences redness, dryness, and tightness. however, when the barrier is healthy, skin appears even-toned, clear, smooth, and balanced.

""‘eat your water’ is a phrase i have been using for many years. staying sufficiently hydrated isn’t just about drinking eight glasses of water a day. when we eat more water-rich foods, we absorb water more slowly because it is trapped in the nutritional structure of these foods. slow absorption means that water in food stays in our bodies longer to optimize hydration. the same rule applies to skin. applying nutrient-rich ingredients will strengthen the skin barrier and help our skin trap and hold onto more water, longer. that’s how the formula for nutrient-charged water gel was born.""—howard murad, m.d., faad

edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. so, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. edible beauty australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. this means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in miron violet glass, which filters damaging uv rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside.

wildcrafted: the use of australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. found growing in remote and arid regions of australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. when used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.
